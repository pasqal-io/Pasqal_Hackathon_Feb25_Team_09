# PiezoQuantum APP

This repository contains the code and resources for the PiezoQuantum APP, which involves simulations and computations related to piezoelectric materials using Python, Streamlit, and various scientific computing libraries.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Conda**: A package, dependency, and environment management system.
2. **Python**: A programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively.

## Installation

### Step 1: Install Conda

If you don't have Conda installed, you can download and install it from the [official Conda website](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

### Step 2: Create a Conda Environment

Create a new Conda environment with Python 3.8 (or any compatible version):

```bash
conda create -n piezoquantum python=3.8

conda activate piezoquantum

Install Required Packages
Install the necessary Python packages using Conda and pip:

conda install -c conda-forge qutip
pip install streamlit pulser

Running the Programs
Running the Streamlit Application
To run the Streamlit application piezo_app_v4.py, navigate to the PiezoQuantum folder and execute the following command:

streamlit run piezo_app_v4.py

This will start a local web server and open the application in your default web browser. You can interact with the app through the browser interface.

Running Python Scripts
To run the Python scripts pm_simulation_ain_compute_c33_e33_d33_8A.py, pm_simulation_ain_crn_compute_d33_v4.py, and pm_simulation_ain_two_three_body_coupling.py, use the following commands:

python pm_simulation_ain_compute_c33_e33_d33_8A.py
python pm_simulation_ain_crn_compute_d33_v4.py
python pm_simulation_ain_two_three_body_coupling.py


Each script will execute its respective simulation or computation. Ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed and that the environment is activated before running these scripts.
